## With a local Python installation:

You will need to have a local installation of Python (2.7 recommended). We recommend that you install Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You then will need to install 
1. [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), which is a rigid body dynamics library
2. [Meshcat](https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat-python), which is a convenient visualizer

With an Anaconda installation, you can run the following:
``conda install pinocchio meshcat-python``

Your environment should then be all set to run the Notebook.
